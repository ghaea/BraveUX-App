# BraveUX-App

Here is the code test.  

Once everything is cloned, go into the folder through the command line.  Then 'npm install' and 'npm start'.  You can then see it in our browser through http://localhost:3000/index.html 

All the code I did is in the public folder under index.html, index.css, and index.js.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!
